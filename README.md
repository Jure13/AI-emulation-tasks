# Simple-AI-games
Several examples of games, written in Python, to be played as/against an AI.

Two of the games are worldwide known and they emulate an AI player, while "Briškula" is a Croatian (Dalmatian)
card game of Italian origin and it pits the player versus the AI.

Rules of 2-player "Briškula":
- 40 cards, divided into 4 suits (batons/bate, coins/dinari, cups/kupe and swords/špade)
- 10 cards per suits are numbered 1-7, 11 (jack/fanat), 12 (knight/konj) and 13 (king/kralj)
- in total, there are 120 points in the game; cards 2-7 are worth no points, while the rest are worth as noted below <br>
------------------------------------- <br>
CARD --------------- POINTS <br>
1 (ace/as) ----------- 11 <br>
3 (three/trica) ------ 10 <br>
13 (king/kralj) ------ 4 <br>
12 (knight/konj) ----- 3 <br>
11 (jack/fanat) ------ 2 <br>
------------------------------------- <br>
- after the deck is shuffled, players are dealt 3 cards each and one card is set as the bottom-most card of the deck,
for everyone to see; that card is briscola/briškula
- each player plays a card, and the winner of the hand is the first to draw the next card
- when the 2 cards are played, the stronger card wins; card strength follows the worth of the cards' points,
as written above
- as an exception, if one player plays a non-briscola suit card and the other player plays a briscola-suit card,
the briscola-suit card wins, regardless of the cards' strength
- if both players play briscola-suit cards, regular strength-rule applies (therefore, briscola-suit ace is the strongest card in the game)
- in the end, player with 61+ points wins; in the case of 60:60 points, the result is a draw
